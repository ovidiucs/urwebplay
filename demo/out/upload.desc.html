<p>HTTP file upload is made convenient, via the abstract types <tt>blob</tt> and <tt>file</tt> in the standard library.  A <tt>blob</tt> is a binary sequence, and a <tt>file</tt> combines a <tt>blob</tt> with MIME type information.  An <tt>upload</tt> form input can be used to accept <tt>file</tt>s from the user.</p>

<p>In the <tt>.urp</tt> file for this example, we give a whitelist of MIME types to be accepted.  The application will echo back to the user any file he uploads as one of those types.  You can try submitting other kinds of files to verify that they are rejected.</p>
